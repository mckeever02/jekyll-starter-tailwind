I’m a social-cognitive psychologist, strategist, consultant, researcher,
  writer and certified coach. I earned a Ph.D. in Cognitive and Neural Sciences
  from the University of South Florida, with specialty in interpersonal
  communication, social cognition and applied behavioral research. I also hold a
  Bachelor of Science in Education (English major) and Master of Science in
  Communication Sciences and Disorders.

  After early stints as an educator and clinical speech-language pathologist, I’ve spent most of my career in the User Experience (UX) field, designing speech technology and complex artificial intelligence systems. During my 13 years at IBM, I was certified as a Thought Leader Consultant and provided user experience advocacy, design, education and consulting for many worldwide Fortune 500 clients. I also completed both of IBM’s prestigious global leadership and social responsibility programs, the Corporate Service Corps, in United Arab Emirates, and Executive Service Corps (Smarter Cities Challenge), in Belfast, Northern Ireland.

  I’ve taught a variety of UX courses, including Human Factors Psychology (USF), several in HFI’s Usability Analyst certification program, and one I developed, Conversational UX Bootcamp. I’ve also created and taught a variety of Design Thinking-style workshops for clients.
