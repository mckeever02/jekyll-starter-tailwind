subtitle: Hiya, Melanie here
description: I’m a social-cognitive psychologist who designs with words.

intro_column_1: "Words are magical and oh-so flexible. Words &ndash; linguistics and social interaction &ndash; have been the focus of a career that has found me as a teacher, writer, therapist, voice user interface designer, researcher, and professional coach. I’ve had what I affectionately refer to as an eclectic career. At first glance, my path seems unlikely at best, bizarre at worst, or just plain lucky. The clear throughline has been this: I’m endlessly fascinated by communication and how it conveys who we are to others."

intro_column_2: "It’s through our speech and language that we understand other people as well. So, I’ve spent a career gathering as much knowledge as I could about communication and social interaction, all the while honing my own through a broad variety of different jobs. I’m a case study in doing the improbable, following your inspiration and continually looking for growth opportunities."
