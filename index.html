        <div>
            <p>Words are magical and oh-so flexible. Words &ndash; linguistics and social interaction &ndash; have been
                the focus of a career that has found me as a teacher, writer, therapist, voice user interface designer,
                researcher, and professional coach. I’ve had what I affectionately refer to as an eclectic career. At
                first glance, my path seems unlikely at best, bizarre at worst, or just plain lucky. The clear
                throughline has been this: I’m endlessly fascinated by communication and how it conveys who we are to
                others.</p>
        </div>
        <div>
            <p>It’s through our speech and language that we understand other people as well. So, I’ve spent a career
                gathering as much knowledge as I could about communication and social interaction, all the while honing
                my own through a broad variety of different jobs. I’m a case study in doing the improbable, following
                your inspiration and continually looking for growth opportunities.</p>
