    <p>I’m a social-cognitive psychologist, strategist, consultant, researcher, writer and certified coach. I earned a Ph.D. in
    Cognitive and Neural Sciences from the University of South Florida, with specialty in interpersonal communication,
    social cognition and applied behavioral research. I also hold a Bachelor of Science in Education (English major) and
    Master of Science in Communication Sciences and Disorders.</p>

    <p>After early stints as an educator and clinical speech-language pathologist, I’ve spent most of my career in the User
    Experience (UX) field, designing speech technology and complex artificial intelligence systems. During my 13 years at
    IBM, I was certified as a Thought Leader Consultant and provided user experience advocacy, design, education and
    consulting for many worldwide Fortune 500 clients. I also completed both of IBM’s prestigious global leadership and
    social responsibility programs, the Corporate Service Corps, in United Arab Emirates, and Executive Service Corps
    (Smarter Cities Challenge), in Belfast, Northern Ireland.</p>

    <p>I’ve taught a variety of UX courses, including Human Factors Psychology (USF), several in HFI’s Usability Analyst
    certification program, and one I developed, Conversational UX Bootcamp. I’ve also created and taught a variety of Design
    Thinking-style workshops for clients.</p>

    <p>My management roles have included Director of Research and Business Analytics at <a href="http://w.motivatedesign.com/">Motivate Design</a>, where I designed and
    executed UX research programs and workshops for First Republic Bank, Chick-Fil-A, Cox, National Institutes of Health,
    PayPal and Penn State University. I’m currently the Senior Vice President of Customer Experience at <a href="https://sweepr.com">Sweepr</a>, a
    Dublin-based technology startup, where UX thought leadership is core to our business strategy.</p>

    <p>My career highlights include a Provost’s Commendation for Outstanding Teaching by a Graduate Student (University of
    South Florida), as well as publication of over 60 articles and 6 U.S. patents. I was on the founding board of the
    Association for Voice Interaction Design (AVIxD). In 2015, I wrote <a href="{{site.book_link}}">Uncovering Truffles: The Scarcity and Value of Women
    in STEM</a> about the experiences of women in male-dominated fields. That same year, I completed my first professional
    coaching certification, followed by Associate Certified Coach credential from the International Coaching Federation in
    2018. My coaching practice serves creatives, UXers and professional women and I’m on the Professional Development Chair of
    the Gulf Coast ICF chapter.</p>

    <p>But my most important roles are partner to my husband of nearly 30 years and mom to a tween boy and girl, plus one very
    friendly Labradoodle. If I’m not working, coaching or mothering, you’ll find me reading, traveling, working on my latest
    writing project or learning something new.</p>
