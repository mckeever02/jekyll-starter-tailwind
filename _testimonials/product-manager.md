Working with Melanie has been wonderful!  Even after a few sessions, I have so many new tools with which to tackle my biggest challenges. I deeply appreciate her ability to provide both technical, in-the-weeds advice for growing my career AND guidance when it comes to bigger picture issues (imposter syndrome! gender bias!).

> “I would highly recommend Melanie to anyone looking for a kind, empowering, empathetic partner in their journey of self-care and self-improvement.”

I personally love that she often provides feedback in the form of observations (“Because you did this”, “I am hearing this”) rather than opinions — it really makes her assessments believable and impactful! I would trust Melanie with addressing a broad range of goals — she’s worked with so many diverse industries and clients within her UX career, and her speech pathology background has really enhanced our coaching. I would highly recommend Melanie to anyone looking for a kind, empowering, empathetic partner in their journey of self-care and self-improvement.
