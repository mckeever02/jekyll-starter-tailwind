Two years ago, I started my career as a freelance UX designer and researcher working with Melanie; I had just come out of a UX bootcamp with little prior UX experience and only a vague idea of the direction in which I wanted to go. It became immediately apparent that I had struck gold with Melanie. She took on her given role as my supervisor and then went above and beyond by becoming my mentor, a role she holds to this day long after I left freelancing to go in-house.

> “Melanie deftly distills years of experience and advanced education in UX and Psychology into actionable, bite-sized, tailored pieces of advice. She is clearly a born educator.”

Her wealth of advice, technical skills, and philosophies have been instrumental for me to move forward in my career as a UX Researcher. I'm now leading research at my company and constantly face complex problems both internally and when conducting the actual research.

Melanie continues to support me, checking in and, as soon as I signal for help, hopping immediately on the phone and/or answering emails. I am so grateful for her dedication to my career and personal growth and it just continually amazes me that I am not the only person she is mentoring!!
