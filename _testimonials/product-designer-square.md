I’ve been talking to Melanie for about three years and the ROI is clear — she has helped me negotiate a 40k raise at one job and 3 months of vacation at another (both of which I thought were impossible before talking to her). But the most valuable part of working with Melanie is not financial.

Like many women, I grew up valuing politeness and conflict-avoidance over expressing my own needs and opinions. That has not served me well working in tech, where both UX design and traditionally-female traits are often overlooked and undervalued. Melanie has challenged me to become more assertive, addressing conflict or directly asking for what I want rather than stewing in resentment.

> “I have recommended Melanie to many friends, and would encourage anyone considering coaching to give it a try.”

I've shifted toward having confidence in my worth as a designer and toward trusting my own beliefs and interpretations of the world, even when they don’t line up with others’. She has also helped me find ways to have influence at work and convince others of my ideas when I assumed no one would change their mind. I still have plenty of anxiety and work challenges, but Melanie has given me a strong set of tools for dealing with hard situations and decisions. I have recommended her to many friends, and would encourage anyone considering coaching to give it a try.
