I came to Melanie feeling lost about my career trajectory. I have worked in the public and nonprofit sector for over a decade and was feeling like I didn’t have much to show for the work I had done. Through Melanie’s coaching sessions, I have transformed my outlook. She helped me identify my strengths and all the skills I have acquired throughout my career path. The work I did with Melanie helped propel me to a new job. While I don’t think this job is my dream job, I am more satisfied at work and I am feeling more hopeful about the opportunities available to me.

> “Melanie approaches each session with genuine curiosity and care, and I always walk away with a little more clarity about myself.”

Melanie was also extremely helpful in navigating discussions with my supervisor, including dealing with negative feedback and asking for a raise (which I was able to receive!). Melanie helped me dissect the issues with my supervisor and helped guide my perspective to grow from a position of fear and helplessness to one of empowerment and action.

I highly recommend Melanie’s coaching services. She approaches each session with genuine curiosity and care, and I always walk away with a little more clarity about myself. Don’t miss out on the opportunity to work with Melanie!
