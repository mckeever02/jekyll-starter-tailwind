excerpt: "Women in Science, Technology, Engineering and Match (STEM) are much
  like truffles: the unique and precious result of many variables converging in
  a single person. Like truffles, a STEM womanâ€™s value may not be superficially
  obvious. She can be destroyed by an environment that disregards her unique,
  subtle but perishable characteristics. But, in the hands of a masterful chef,
  the truffle is treated like the treasure it is, a star of the finest cuisine
  in the world."
