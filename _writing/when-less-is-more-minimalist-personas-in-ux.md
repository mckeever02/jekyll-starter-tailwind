title: "When less is more: Minimalist personas in UX"
date: 2020-08-28T15:53:46.928Z
time: August 2020
excerpt: Minimalist personas are brief, evidence-based character sketches that
  are specific, concise and based on psychographic user variables. They are used
  to simplify and highlight critical information about target users, leading to
  clearer communication, better design prioritization and more alignment among
  stakeholders. I provide 3 case studies and 8 ways to design minimalist
  personas so they are more believable, generalizable, compelling and resistant
  to stereotyping.
