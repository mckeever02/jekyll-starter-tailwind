  responses to speech-based e-service"
date: 2020-05-15T23:00:00.000Z
time: 2005
excerpt: Using a theoretical foundation derived from research in social
  cognition, interpersonal communication, psycholinguistics, human factors, and
  services marketing, two studies develop items for a speech interface usability
  scale, which is then used to examine interrelationships among individual
  differences (e.g., self-monitoring, need for interaction with a service
  provider, inherent novelty seeking), usability, comfort, and customer
  satisfaction).
