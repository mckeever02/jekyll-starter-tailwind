  What’s your favourite thing about working in UX research?


  Variety. The weirder, more constrained or complicated a research study is, the more fun I’ll have with it. I really like it when someone says to me we’re curious about this issue but you only have a limited budget. Taking that kind of complexity and figuring out a little path through the mess to the insights is really fun for me.
