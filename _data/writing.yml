  excerpt: "Women in Science, Technology, Engineering and Match (STEM) are much like truffles: the unique and precious result of many variables converging in a single person. Like truffles, a STEM woman’s value may not be superficially obvious. She can be destroyed by an environment that disregards her unique, subtle but perishable characteristics. But, in the hands of a masterful chef, the truffle is treated like the treasure it is, a star of the finest cuisine in the world."
