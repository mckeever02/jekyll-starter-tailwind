## The Challenge

Sweepr, a technology startup based in Dublin, Ireland is building a software platform that uses speech technology and artificial intelligence to provide contextually-adaptive self-service for consumers in their home. My role as Senior VP of Customer Experience is to differentiate our product through unique features that create an excellent customer experience.

## The Solution

One of my first contributions to Sweepr came in the form of research that I’d already been working on for nearly 15 years: a deep understanding of what motivates people to select self-service over other available forms of support and then return to it again and again. In 2001, when I entered the UX field, I became interested in the aspects of personality and user interface design that would create compelling experiences. My dissertation research showed that risk-taking, the personality variable that plays a role in “risky” behaviors like skydiving, motorcycle riding, and even alcohol consumption, also governed whether people were satisfied with advanced technologies like speech recognition.

> My personas, known as Avoidant, Optimistic and Confident, are central to Sweepr’s strategy and value proposition.

From this initial finding, I continued to develop my understanding of the key variables that cause people to use self-service. As my UX career progressed from speech technology to include websites, mobile apps and even physical products, I continued to explore the key personality variables. By the time I joined Sweepr in 2019, I had described three clear consumer personas that applied to our self-service products.

To date, I have developed an approach to UX design and writing for self-service content development based on the three end user personas. In addition, I’ve operationalized and quantified methods for our platform to identify a user’s persona during onboarding and incrementally change their persona as they use the product. These innovations have been codified into the platform and are a central plank of Sweepr’s value proposition. Finally, I’ve designed an ongoing research program to understand the specific behavioral and attitudinal issues that differentiate the personas and feed continued product innovation.
