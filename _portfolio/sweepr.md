## The Challenge

Alan Coleman, a successful entrepreneur in Dublin, Ireland sent me an email one day, saying he had heard about me and thought we needed to talk. He was starting a new company that was focused on using speech technology and artificial intelligence to create self-service support, one that users would love and return to again and again. He knew that UX was essential but needed someone who knew how to execute on the vision.

## The Solution

After consulting for several months, I joined Sweepr as the SVP of Customer Experience in April 2019. In this role, I report to the CEO and am responsible for creating a delightful, motivating user experience for a complex, multimedia, intelligent technology. I lead a growing team of talented UX designers and also serve as the highest ranking female leader in the organization. In addition to being Sweepr’s first copywriter, voice designer, and user researcher, I’m using my skills in organizational psychology, consulting and coaching to develop our company philosophy; scope, close and execute customer projects; train internal teams; develop content strategy, marketing and sales collateral; and execute on our company mission and vision.


> I’m continuing to develop and research three personas at Sweepr, which underlie the design of our compelling self-service approach.
