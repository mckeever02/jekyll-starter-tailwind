## The Challenge

Chick-Fil-A wanted to explore the pick up process for ordering food using its mobile app and understand where opportunities existed to create a more satisfying, streamlined Guest experience.

## The Solution

I scoped, designed and helped to close the sale of this complex ethnographic research project, then acted as the lead researcher in a team of two during its execution.

The project included 27 CFA customers who placed an order on their personal mobile phone, then traveled to their local CFA franchise to pick up the order. We interviewed about their experience. Data collection included observed usability problems by ordering phase, open-ended questions about the experience and quantitative ratings of participant perceptions of service quality, intent to use the app again, and satisfaction.

> We traveled (remotely and in-person) to 23 restaurants located in Houston, Los Angeles, Baltimore and Charleston.

The study also included interviews with 6 franchise owners about the strategic role of mobile ordering in their restaurant, along with challenges and opportunities.

We identified five phases of a mobile order and quantified Guests’ most impactful usability problems and satisfaction with each phase. Design improvements to the mobile app included providing more feedback to the user during the order confirmation and travel phase, as well as clear instructions upon arrival at the restaurant.

CFA subsequently requested heuristic reviews of new experience flows based on our recommendations, along with a re-assessment of the mobile app experience nearly one year later.
