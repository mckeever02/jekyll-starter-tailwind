## The Challenge

Chick-Fil-A deployed a digital learning platform for employees of its restaurant franchisees nationwide. After receiving some early feedback that it wasn’t working as planned, the Training team at CFA’s Atlanta Support Center approached Motivate Design with a request for consulting.

## The Solution

I designed, scoped, helped to close and executed on a multi-stage research program that focused on usability of the digital learning platform, as well as the needs and requirements of employees in the restaurants (Operators, training managers, shift leads and team members) to articulate how the Support Center’s Training team might best assist their franchisees in developing skilled employees.

The research program included several rounds of interviews to understand restaurant training strategy, as well as task-based usability testing with learners and administrators on the platform. In all, over 60 employees and 30 restaurants were represented in 6 rounds of research.

In addition, the year-long program included interactive workshops with several cross-functional teams, as well as collaboration with CFA’s digital platform vendor, other training vendors and a coaching-consultation effort to assist with implementation of recommendations.
