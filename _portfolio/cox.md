## The Challenge

Cox determined that their self-install cable kit was not being successfully completed by customers, who instead preferred to have a skilled technician come to their home and complete the installation. This resulted in significant cost and Cox wanted to understand why users were not successful in completing the self-installation, then provide a more usable and successful experience.

## The Solution

Over the course of nearly a year, I served as the Project Lead for a team that included visual designers, product designers, UX researchers and project managers. I assisted in scoping and closing sale of the project, then designed the project plan and research phases, oversaw project  execution and served as the lead researcher in the final round of testing. I also led several key client workshops to align and engage various stakeholders across the business.

The phases of the project included an initial research phase of a heuristic evaluation of the physical self-install kit, followed by ethnographic research observing customers self-install internet service in their own home. Based on findings, a redesign of the kit itself was completed, which included a new box for the kit, redesign of internal trays and organization of materials, new labels for cords and a new instruction card. The team also designed journey maps of the self-install experience in the context of customer onboarding. After a prototype kit was developed, I led a second round of usability testing in Coxâ€™s usability lab in Atlanta, which led to my revision of written instructions to be simpler, without jargon, and casual in tone so they were easy to follow and appealing to even reluctant users. The project concluded with delivery of the final design of the physical box, labels for cords and a second revision of the instruction card.
