## The Challenge

The Conversational UX team at Allstate had been increasing in size and their manager, Susan Thome, approached me about training the team in psychology and UX methods appropriate for voice user interface design.

## The Solution

I presented a two-day, on-site interactive workshop for a team of 20 voice designers, chat designers, UX researchers and content strategists.

> The bootcamp surveyed foundational topics in communication and UX (Basic Training), including normal human conversation, social cognition and the UX process.

The second day emphasized the evidence-based factors of speech usability and their design correlates (Marksmanship Training). Throughout the workshop, I emphasized hands-on practice in applying concepts and new tools to improve the rigor of design practice, including heuristic assessment, usability testing and methods for rapid iterative design and test of speech or chat user interfaces. The final review of the course indicated that participants rated the Bootcamp extremely positively for Basic Training (mean=6.56, sd=0.81), Marksmanship Training (mean=6.33, sd=0.82), instructor knowledge and teaching skill (mean=6.88, sd=0.50), team and peer interaction (mean=6.25, sd=1.18), and materials (mean=6.06, sd=1.29).
